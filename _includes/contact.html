Anyone will be able to host a tournament and those hosts will be able to earn cash. We will support a myriad of games that will be hosted directly from the website as well as additional games that will be hosted by Crucible alone. This is a very exciting future for eSports and all gamers that enjoy sharing content and participating in tournaments both public and private.
